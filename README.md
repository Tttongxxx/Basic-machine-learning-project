# Forecasting Projects

I did two individual projects regarding to forecast based on machine learning techniques. Both of the asms I gained top tier accuracy.

In the first project I exploring finding a model that is capable to capture customer withdraw pattern behaviours for the Australian banking systems. KNN and Regression models (Multiple linear regression, logistic regression etc.) are the main technique for implement the idea. 

The second project I pitch the optimal time series model in order to forecast CPI index. The data we have are quartly time data in regards to CPI index. The optimal model is seasonal naive and TCES, which have a robust performance on both training set, validation set, and test set. 

MSE and RMSE were selected as the main out-sample accuracy measure in the two projects. Both of the project have a small error on each set, suggests the model is capable to capture most of the data and has a good generalisation on unseened data. For in-sample accuracy measure, AIC&BIC, R-squared are selected.
